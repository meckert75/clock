# Clock

Simple HTML project, experimenting with SVG and some simple animation. This clock is drawn based on the blue print by Hans Hilfiker.

An additional interesting quirk that is reproduced here is that the second hand runs fast, then comes to a short halt at the top of the minute before making another rotation.
Jerry Wu Hu made a great video about the reason behind the clocks unique behavior.
